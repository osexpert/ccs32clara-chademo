Older models (approx. 2018–2021): 
These used a 12 kWh or 13.8 kWh battery, with a total voltage measuring around 300V. Some models feature a nominal voltage of 292V, 
with a maximum of 328V and a minimum of 220V, according to hybridbatteries.co.nz.
so...target may be = 340?

Newer models (approx. 2023 and up): 
These models received a larger 20 kWh lithium-ion battery. The (red: nominal) battery voltage for the 2023 Outlander PHEV is 350V, according to specs from Le Guide de l'auto.
So with nominal 350...target may be 410v? Or 400?

Recent models (2025 refresh): Some models from 2025 come with a larger 22.7 kWh battery, which also affects the overall voltage.

Some screenshot from ODB: 68% 367.6v
So...target may be 410v?
