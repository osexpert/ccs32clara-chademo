1 piece relay
HF49FD-012-1H11
coil voltage: 12v
switching max: 5A 30VDC
Guess: main relay

2 pieces relay
HFD4/12-S
coil voltage: 12v
switching max: 2A 30VDC
Guess: 1 for adapter contactor, 1 for chademo d1.
Undersized for chademo d1, its on the edge of the spec: 12V 2A continously. Peak will be a lot higher.
Small relay closest to battery: d2 (assumed)
Small relay farthest away from battery: adapter contactor (assumed)

Ultra-wide input voltage dc/dc converter.
make: ND
model: NH25-V2S12R6-C
Input 210-1200V DC
